# ED-Code-Sample

Here is a smaller project I did with Eating Disorder data as a code sample. The .Rmd file contains the source code and write-up without rendered plots or code output. You can view the the knitted document \(final product with rendered visuals and code output\) as either a pdf or html. I recommend downloading and viewing the html file as I find the formatting a little nicer in that version.
